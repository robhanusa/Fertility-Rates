# Fertility Rate by Country Prediction

[Analysis of fertility rate data by country](https://github.com/robhanusa/Fertility-Rates/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb) uses machine learning to develop a decision tree model that predicts whether a country's fertility rate is above or below the replacement fertility rate (2.1 births per woman) based on a number of other statistics about that country. The data is a subset of a real dataset from the World Health Organization, that was queried from Google's Bigquery database. Region data was added later, so the model had to account for both categorical and continuous data.
